# The RoleBasedGroup API 

RoleBasedGroup: An API for for orchestrating distributed workload services with multi-role collaboration and automated service discovery. It aims to address common deployment patterns of AI/ML inference workloads, especially Prefill/Decode engine disaggregation workloads (e.g. a prefill, decode, scheduler, etc.) where the LLM will be sharded and run across multiple devices on multiple nodes. 

## üìñ Overview

### Background
Traditional Kubernetes statefulset struggle with multi-role coordination in distributed stateful service scenarios. This solution addresses:
- Startup order dependencies between roles  
- Complex cross-role service discovery  
- Fragmented configuration management  

### üß© Key Features
   ‚ú® **Multi-template Role Specification** - Model a distributed stateful workload as a group of K8s Workloads.  
   **Multi-Role Startup Sequencing** - Define role dependencies a startup order for the ReplicatedJobs in a RoleBasedGroup.       
   üîç **Auto Service Discovery** - Inject topology info via config files and environment variables  
   ‚ö° **Elastic Scaling** - Support group/role-level scaling  
     **Rollout and Rolling update** -  It will be performed at the group level, which means we upgrade the groups one by one as a unit (i.e. the pods within a group are updated together).
     **Topology-aware placement** - Be able to ensure that pods in the same group will be co-located in the same topology.
     **All-or-nothing restart for failure handling** - Some ML inference stacksrequire all pods in the group to be recreated if one pod in the group failed or one container in the pods is restarted.
