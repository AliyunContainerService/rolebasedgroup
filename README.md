# The RoleBasedGroupSet API 

RoleBasedGroupSet: An API for for orchestrating distributed workload services with multi-role collaboration and automated service discovery.

## üìñ Overview

### Background
Traditional Kubernetes statefulset struggle with multi-role coordination in distributed stateful service scenarios. This solution addresses:
- Startup order dependencies between roles  
- Complex cross-role service discovery  
- Fragmented configuration management  

### üß© Key Features
   **Multi-template Role Specification** - RoleBasedGroupSet models a distributed stateful workload as a group of K8s Workloads. This allows a user to easily specify different pod templates for different distinct groups of pods (e.g. a prefill, decode, scheduler, etc.), something which cannot be done by a single Statefulset.
‚ú® **Multi-Role Startup Sequencing** - Define role dependencies a startup order for the ReplicatedJobs in a RoleBasedGroupSet. This enables support for patterns like the ‚Äúleader-worker‚Äù paradigm, where the leader must be running before the workers should start up and connect to it. 
üîç **Auto Service Discovery** - applications discover peers via native DNS and pre-loaded YAML endpoints. Dynamic updates propagate through ConfigMap versioning without pod restarts. 
‚ö° **Elastic Scaling** - Support group/role-level scaling flexible capacity management. Scale entire groups for capacity bursts (`spec.replicas`), adjust role replicas for workload balance. Built on StatefulSet controllers, scaling maintains stable network identities and ordered deployment semantics. 
üì¶ **Unified Configuration** - Dual injection via YAML and environment variables

  name: demo-group
spec:
  replicas: 2
  groupTemplate:
    roles:
      - role: prefill
        replicas: 2
        template: { ... }
      - role: decode
        replicas: 2
        dependencies: ["prefill"]
        template: { ... }
```
