# It is provided to allow the cluster admin to help manage permissions for users.
#
# Grants full permissions ('*') over workloads.x-k8s.io.
# This role is intended for users authorized to modify roles and bindings within the cluster,
# enabling them to delegate specific permissions to other users or groups as needed.
